* overview

ideas for something to grab pictures from my camera and put them in
appropriate places, rather like the album ripping stuff. general ideas
for structure:


* structure I

** ~/multimedia/photographs/YEAR/MM/DD/###.jpeg

where ### is the picture-number. that is, all pictures downloaded on a
certain day would go into that day's folder. this would be the
canonical name of the photo.

also in here could be files like:

###.caption -- containing the caption, obviously
###.blurb -- containing a story about the picture
###.thumb.jpeg -- thumbnail

then, the following symbolic-link structures would be set up:

** ~/multimedia/photographs/albums/nice-album-name/### -> ../../../YEAR/MM/DD/###

so each picture-rip would then give one the opportunity to put things
into albums. as in, it would say, for each picture, "give me an album
name" and default to the last-entered album-name. each album would
have a numberically increasing list of files pointing to particular
canonical pictures.

these could also have ###.blurb files, which would describe the entire
album.

** ~/multimedia/photographs/keyword/some-keyword/### -> ../../albums/nice-album-name

* structure II

second idea for structure of the data, based mostly on SGML
metadata. this has the advantage of being able to add stuff easily
(although so does the other scheme, sort of). this does keep all the
metadata contained and keeps file-clutter to a minimum, i guess.

** ~/multimedia/photographs/YEAR/MM/DD/###.jpeg

where ### is the picture-number. that is, all pictures downloaded on a
certain day would go into that day's folder. this would be the
canonical name of the photo.

then, there could be a "database" of SGML files (i.e. like my Web
site) containing all the relevant metadata.

this directory could also have things like ###.sgml with relevant
metadata for this particular photograph (i.e. all the EXIF data, plus
hand-entered description and so forth).

** ~/multimedia/photographs/metadata/albums/album-name.sgml

contains some sort of SGML for an entire album, including
descriptions, etc.


* DTD?

possible DTD for picture meta-data:

<picture>
  <canonical_path>/home/mike/multimedia/pictures/2003/10/02/000.jpeg</canonical_path>
  <date>October 2, 2003</date>

  <!-- EXIF stuff; lots to choose from -- let's see what the G1
       produces. i could just dump it all into a single <exif />
       tag... -->

  <title>Hand-Entered Title</title>
  <category>category0</category>
  <category>category1</category>

  <keyword></keyword>
  <keyword></keyword>

  <album>album title 0</album>
  <album>album title 1</album>

</picture>
