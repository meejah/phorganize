This is just a collection of scripts I use to "organize" and play with
my photos (and video). Perhaps they will be useful to you also.

I'm currently transitioning a few things and don't have an
eeezee-to-use catorizing thing, but the basic idea is that I suck all
my photos into "somewhere" and then categorize them (e.g. using
xli/feh and "mv"), after which I edit the good ones.

"Categorize" means moving them into a folder like
~/photos/INCOMING/june-15-2011--some-sort-of-trip and if I edit
anything it goes from IMG_1234.JPG to IMG_1234-adjusted-cropped.JPG or
similar.

I also have been backing up nearly everything to flickr (as "private"
photos which nobody can see). To use any of the flickr stuff, you'll
need an API key (see their site for details).

No time has been spent cleaning this up except to make sure I'm not
giving away passwords, I just figured someone might find it useful so
a "git push" somewhere wouldn't hurt.
